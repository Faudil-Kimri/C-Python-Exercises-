projects and examples . 
 
SO IN THIS DIRECTORY I WILL CHECKPOINT EVERY STEP I MAKE WHILE BUILDING MY FINAL YEAR PROJECT . IT WILL BE AN IDENTITY MANAGEMET SYSTEM BASED ON BLOCKCHAIN .
MY KNOWLEDGE IS VERY LIMITED IN A LOT OF THINGS , HOPEFULLY I STUDIED THE BASICS OF BLOCKCHAIN . TILL NOW I KNOW THAT I WILL BE USING SMART CONTRACTS TO PERFORM 
CONDITIONS IN THE NETWORK LOCALLY , HASH FUNCTIONS AND PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION SHOULD BE NEEDED TOO . 
THE PROJECT IS VERY SIMPLE , THE IDEA IS SIMPLE USERS SIGN UP AND THEY ADD THEY IDENTIFICATION PAPERS SUCH AS ( ID,DRIVER LICENCE )
AN INFRASTRCTURE X WILL SIGN-UP TOO BUT SHE ONLY REQUEST ACCESS TO THESE PAPERS TO THE USERS
YOU AS A USER YOU ALLOW THE PAPERS THAT YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE X . 
THIS SYSTEM I BELIEVE WHAT I BLOCKCHAIN CAN DO FIRST OF ALL . THAT IS CAN GUARANTEE THE REAL IDENTITY OF THE PERSON ON THE NET . THE REAL IDENTITY OF THE COMPANY 
ON THE NET 
I WILL ADD SOME FUNCTIONALITIES LATER IF I CAN.
